USER QUERY: "{user_query}"

Generate 3 specific search queries for each database to find NEGATIVE signals (failures, toxicity, adverse events, terminations):

1. **PubMed queries**: Focus on finding literature about adverse events, toxicity, failed efficacy, or negative outcomes.
   - Use specific medical terminology
   - Include terms like "toxicity", "adverse events", "cardiotoxicity", "failure", "ineffective"
   - Example: "pembrolizumab cardiotoxicity case reports"

2. **ClinicalTrials.gov queries**: Focus on finding terminated/suspended/withdrawn trials.
   - Use drug names, company names, or therapy types
   - Keep queries concise (the API will filter for failed trials automatically)
   - Example: "pembrolizumab"

Return your response in this EXACT JSON format:
{{
  "pubmed": ["query1", "query2", "query3"],
  "clinicaltrials": ["query1", "query2", "query3"]
}}

Only respond with valid JSON, no additional text.
